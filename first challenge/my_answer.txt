I understood that the output in IE6 is different from the outputs in other IE versions, for the same code.
Therefore, I assumed that IE6 must generate the code diffrently than other versions.
From a quick search in google, I found out that IE6 can't handle accessing characters in strings like arrays (for example - str[1]). The prefered way to do so is by using charAt function.
I also looked at lz-string's git, and saw a commit they preformed for fixing this bug. This way, I quickly detected the problematic code, and fixed it.
